/**
 * Class Bicycle demonstrates constructor chaining using keyword "this".
 * The more complex constructors all call the simpler ones, thereby
 * chaining the calls 'DOWNWARDS' (from the constructor with the most
 * parameters to the default no-parameter constructor. Ensure that you implement it in this order).
 * This approach works, however the default constructor will assign data that 
 * will likely be replaced as the constructors chain their calls.
 * See class Car for comparison.
 * 
 * Bicycle() assigns default values to the fields.
 * 
 * Bicycle(String) calls Bicycle() which assigns default values, then program flow
 * returns to Bicycle(String) which assigns a value to variety a second time.
 * 
 * Bicycle(String, boolean) calls Bicycle(String) which calls Bicycle() which 
 * assigns default values, then program flow returns to Bicycle(String) which 
 * assigns a value to variety a second time, then program flow returns to 
 * Bicycle(String, boolean) which assigns a value to isElectric a second time.
 * 
 * Bicycle(String, boolean, double) calls Bicycle(String, boolean) which calls
 * Bicycle(String, boolean) which calls Bicycle(String) which calls Bicycle() and
 * Bicycle() assigns the default values to the fields, then program flow returns
 * to Bicycle(String) which assigns a value to variety a second time, then program
 * flow returns to Bicycle(String, boolean) which assigns a value to isElectric
 * a second time, then program flow returns to Bicycle(String, boolean, double) 
 * which assigns a value a second time to weight.
 * 
 * NOTE: The constructors in this code have System.out.println(a-message) in them,
 *       for demonstration purposes only. DO NOT PUT input / output
 *       into constructors in production code!!!
